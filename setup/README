# Notes for instructors

## Laptops Setup Instructions

Customize the `install.sh` script for your own workshop labtops configuration.

Copy the 3 files onto a USB Key or shared folder.

Then open the folder on every laptop to configure and type the commands

```shell
cd /media/devnet/EC9F-B5F8

cp install.sh ~/.local/bin

chmod 755 ~/.local/bin/install.sh 

install.sh
```

> note that when starting the workshop, ask the audience to do a git pull to refresh their local copy of the repo to your latest edits.


## Prepare your machine

Change your shell prompt in order to maximize the command line visibile to the audience

```shell
PS1='\[\033[0;32m\]\h\[\033[0m\]$ '
```
